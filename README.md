# wp-docker-compose-template

### Template created for MacOS

Docker (Desktop) must be installed & running in order for the .yml to work

Download this .yml into your project folder. After that, open terminal and cd into the folder.

Type: `docker-compose up -d`

It should download required images (mariadb, wordpress), and create new Docker volumes/containers automatically. 

After progress is done, it should display `[+] Running 5/5` with no errors. 

Check the Docker app for logs, etc.
